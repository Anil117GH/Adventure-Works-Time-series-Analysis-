This project includes three fully interactive Power BI dashboards. The Sales Performance Dashboard tracks key metrics such as total sales, profit, return rate, and average order value, featuring visuals like a forecasted line chart, top 10 product rankings, and a product category breakdown, with filters for region, product, and date. The Customer Insights Dashboard focuses on customer-level analysis, displaying revenue per customer, weekly trends, and occupation-wise order volumes. It also includes DAX-powered logic for customer segmentation based on income level and priority flags, along with drill-down functionality to explore individual customer behavior. The third report, the Geographic Sales Overview, maps sales performance across countries including the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia, providing insights into regional performance and supporting strategic decision-making across global markets.

**Key Insights Uncovered** 
- The top 10 products drive the majority of sales but also show higher return rates, highlighting opportunities to improve product quality or fulfillment.
- Weekly revenue trends reveal seasonal spikes and dips, offering insights for demand forecasting and inventory planning.
- Customers from high-income brackets and those with Skilled Manual occupations generate significantly higher revenue per user.
- The United States and United Kingdom are the strongest performing regions, while Canada and Germany show high growth potential.
- Product-level analysis indicates that certain categories have high order volumes but lower profitability, pointing to areas for pricing or cost optimization.

**Learning Outcomes**
- Developed end-to-end Power BI Desktop proficiency through project-based learning using the AdventureWorks dataset and real-world business scenarios.
- Built a normalized, relational data model using primary/foreign keys and implemented a Star Schema design to optimize performance and maintain data integrity.
- Gained a deep understanding of Power BI vs. Excel, including key advantages such as advanced data modeling, visual storytelling, and scalable ETL capabilities.
- Designed efficient data pipelines using Power Query, leveraging tools like Column Profiling, Data Quality Checks, Merge/Append Queries, and Calendar Tables.
- Mastered essential DAX functions, including aggregation (SUM, COUNTROWS), logic (IF, SWITCH), filtering (CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL), and time intelligence (DATESYTD, DATEADD)   to create dynamic and reusable measures.
- Implemented filter context and row context principles for advanced calculations, while using measure tables and explicit measures to maintain a clean and scalable report     model.
- Optimized dashboards with proper use of report-level filters, bi-directional relationships (when necessary), and visual-level interactions, while maintaining best practices in model performance.


**Tools & Technologies Used**
- Power BI Desktop for building interactive dashboards and visual reports.
- Power Query Editor for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning (ETL).
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated measures, KPIs, and implementing time intelligence.
- Data Modeling Tools to create relationships using a star schema (fact & dimension tables).
- Built-in Power BI Visuals including bar/column charts, line charts, donut charts, card visuals, map visuals, and slicers
- Calendar Table for supporting dynamic time-based filtering and calculations.
- Data Profiling Tools such as Column Quality, Column Distribution, and Column Profile for ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
- Custom Sorting and Hierarchies to enable drill-down and enhance user interactivity
